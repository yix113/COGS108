    "## Background & Introduction: \n",
    "   \n",
    "Despite the global progress that has been made on women’s rights in the past couple decades, women’s rights still deserve our attention, especially in developing regions. Higher mortality rate of women compared to that of men still persists in some Asian and African countries, due to reasons such as female infanticide and comparative neglect of female health and nutrition caused by patriarchal bias in traditional values (Sen, 1992; Bunch, 1990). However, recent years have witnessed a positive shift of women’s rights in these developing regions due to the changes of roles that developing countries play within the global economy. \n",
    "\n",
    "As industries move their labor-intensive manufacturing from developed countries to developing countries to take advantage of the cheaper labor, an unprecedented need for unskilled, stable but inexpensive workers emerged in these developing countries. The new labor market provided employment opportunities for women in developing countries who were previously confined to their home and worked as unpaid labor in a family setting. The relatively steady pay from the factory jobs in ‘sweatshops’ has the potential of elevating the financial status of women in these regions (Kabeer, 2004). \n",
    "\n",
    "An improvement in economic status could aid women in these regions to combat the restrictions imposed on them by the conservative social environment. For example, in Bangladesh, a predominantly agriculture dependent country where half of the population still struggled with poverty, the rise of garment factories provided employment opportunities for women who were previously confined to domestic settings and were provided very limited choices for earning their own living due to cultural restrictions and discriminations at the market place (Kabeer, 2004). Although the working conditions are still very hostile, with long hours, mistreatments from employers, and delayed pay, female garment workers interviewed expressed the opinion that the new-found financial power allows them to renegotiate their marriage relationship, gain self-confidence, and build social networks outside of a domestic setting. Similarly, researchers have found that employment opportunities in labor-intensive manufacturing factories aid women to pursue their relative freedom in Latin America, Southern China, and Turkey, despite the general hostile working conditions judged by Western standards. \n",
    "\n",
    "With the support of the findings in previous literature, we would like to further investigate whether an upward development in economy in general helps with the progress of women’s rights, due to a potential increase in employment opportunities and subsequently an improvement of social environment. We would predict that the most significant improvement in women’s rights would be seen in developing countries following an increase in trade and national income. \n",

    "## Methods: \n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Cleaning / Pre-processing\n",
    "For women's rights, we decided to investigate the following specific indices: women's security, women's movement, parental rights in marriage, inheritance rights for widows, and inheritance rights for daughters. To evaluate the wealth of the nations, we decided to investigate the following indices: revenue from trade taxes, compliance costs of importing and exporting, and government tax income. We are going to remove unrelated variables from the original dataset and then exclude developed countries from our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Data Analysis - First, we are going to drop the countries that have missing data on the target index categories. Then, we are planning to stack the variables and then recode new variables by subtracting the previous year’s index from the more current one to reflect changes (e.g. Revenue from trade taxes 2012 - revenue from trade taxes 2008). We are going to calculate the pearson correlations between these variables of change scores. We are also planning to use linear regression model with a composite score of changes in women’s rights as the outcome and changes in economic factors as predictors. For linear regression, the score of changes would be calculated by subtracting the same index score of year 2008 from the most current index score of year 2016.\n",
    "\n",
    "What to report - We are going to report the results of correlation analysis and regression analysis. We are going to present descriptive statistics of the changes of scores in histogram for each index category. We are also going to use scatterplot with fitted regression line to visualize our regression model.)\n",

    "## Privacy / Ethics Considerations:\n",
    "This dataset is from Kaggle Open Dataset; therefore, we do not need to acquire to acquire any specific permission to use this dataset. Moreover, since the dataset only includes indices about countries, the dataset does not risk exposing any private information of any individual in particular or any potential sensitive information involving national security. Some countries are not included in the dataset, such as North Korea, Iraq, and Somalia, which can be a potential bias when we are analysing all of the developing countries as a whole. However, we do not have control over the missing data and therefore we would not be able to solve this issue. We do not think that that the lack of information on these countries will significantly influence our results, considering the relatively small number of missing data. Currently we do not foresee any potential harm or privacy issues that might be caused by our usage of this dataset in the future."

    "## Conclusions & Discussion: \n",
    "\n",
    "If our hypothesis is correct, it would mean that labor-intensive manufacturing industries in developing countries do predict with improving women's rights in these regions by providing women with more financial freedom. This information could provide directions for future interventions of improving women's rights in places where women's rights are historically neglected. For example, if manufacturing jobs in 'sweatshops' actually help these female workers to maintain their relative freedom, international organizations should be cautious about applying a universal payrate standard or working condition standard, since these forced interventions, despite being well-intended, could take away the 'competitive edge' of these unskilled women workers and therefore cause them to lose their jobs. \n",
    "\n",
    "One potential pitfall of this study is that we do not have a comprehensive measure for women's financial freedom specifically or women's average income in these countries. Therefore, if the methods don’t work, we can find some other datasets with comprehensive measures of women’s financial freedom (i.e. women's incomes, etc.) and compare these data with this dataset to see whether there are any more significant relationships. If the data does not show significant relationship between national income and women’s rights, it could mean that women were not able to reap their part of increase of national wealth and the manufacturing jobs did not significantly improve their life condition. Therefore, it might suggest that future international intervention for women’s rights in these regions should focus on how to create more employment opportunities for women specifically in these regions so that women could reap these financial benefits in the future."
